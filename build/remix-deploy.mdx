Avalanche's Primary Network is a Subnet that has three chains: P-Chain, X-Chain,
and C-Chain. The C-Chain is an instance of the Ethereum Virtual Machine powered
by Avalancheâ€™s Snowman consensus protocol.

The [C-Chain RPC](/reference/avalanchego/c-chain/api.md) can do anything a typical Ethereum
client can by using the Ethereum-standard RPC calls. The immediate benefits of
using the C-Chain rather than Ethereum are all of the benefits of using
Avalanche. These properties could considerably improve the performance of
Dapps and the user experience.

Today, we will deploy and test a smart contract on Avalanche using Remix and Core Wallet.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setting up Core">
    If you don't already have a Core wallet, follow this
    [guide](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/6100129-core-extension-how-do-i-create-a-new-wallet)
    to create a new wallet. If you want to use the **Avalanche C-Chain**, it can be selected from the networks list.

    To switch to the **Fuji test network**, go to Settings, select Advanced, and then turn Testnet Mode on.

    **Local Testnet Settings:** [(Avalanche Network Runner Tutorial)](/tooling/network-runner.md)

    - **Network Name**: Avalanche Local C-Chain
    - **New RPC URL**:
    [http://127.0.0.1:34890/ext/bc/C/rpc](http://127.0.0.1:34890/ext/bc/C/rpc)
    - **ChainID**: `43112`
    - **Symbol**: `AVAX`
    - **Explorer**: N/A

  <Step title="Funding Your C-Chain Address">

    #### Using Core Web

    On the Mainnet, you can use [Core
    web](https://core.app/) to transfer funds from the X-Chain to your
    C-Chain address.
    
    The process is simple, as explained in this
    [tutorial](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/8133713-core-web-how-do-i-make-cross-chain-transfers-in-core-stake).
    
    Please note that you will need [Core wallet](https://join.core.app/extension) connected to Core web for making cross-chain transfers.
    Core wallet can be used on test and local networks, too. 
    This wallet is available for [mobile](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/6115608-core-mobile-where-can-i-download-core-mobile-to-my-phone) too.

    #### Using Testnet Faucet

    For funding on the test network, Avalanche has a
    [Faucet](https://faucet.avax.network/) that drips test tokens to the address of
    your choice.
    
    If you already have an AVAX balance greater than zero on Mainnet, 
    paste your C-Chain address there, and request test tokens. Otherwise, 
    please request a faucet coupon on 
    [Guild](https://guild.xyz/avalanche).
    
    Admins and mods on the official [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/RwXY7P6)
    can provide testnet AVAX if developers are unable to obtain it from the other two options.

    #### Funding on Local Testnet

    On a local network, you can easily fund your addresses by following
    [this](/build/subnet/hello-subnet.md#importing-the-test-private-key).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Core and Deploy a Smart Contract Using Remix">
    Open [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) -&gt; Select Solidity

    <Frame><img src="/images/remix-core-guide/remix.png" /></Frame>

    Load or create the smart contracts that we want to compile and deploy using Remix file explorer.

    For this example, we will deploy a simple Hello World contract from [here](https://blog.chain.link/how-to-create-a-hello-world-smart-contract-with-solidity/).

    <Frame><img src="/images/remix-core-guide/contract.png" /></Frame>

    Select the Solidity compiler tab and compile the contract.

    <Frame><img src="/images/remix-core-guide/compile.png" /></Frame>

    Navigate to Deploy & Run transactions Tab -&gt; Open the "ENVIRONMENT" drop-down and select
    Injected Provider (make sure Core is loaded).

    <Frame><img src="/images/remix-core-guide/provider.png" /></Frame>

    A pop up will ask which wallet to use. Select Core.

    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

    <Frame><img src="/images/remix-core-guide/wallet.png" /></Frame>

    </div>

    Now, the smart contract is compiled, Core is injected, and we are ready to
    deploy our Hello world contract. Click "Deploy."

    <Frame><img src="/images/remix-core-guide/deploy.png" /></Frame>

    Confirm the transaction on the Core pop up.

    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

    <Frame><img src="/images/remix-core-guide/approve.png" /></Frame>

    </div>

    Our contract is successfully deployed!

    <Frame><img src="/images/remix-core-guide/deployed.png" /></Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Testing your Contract">
    Now, we can expand it by selecting it from the "Deployed Contracts" tab and test it out.

    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
        <Frame><img src="/images/remix-core-guide/interact.png" /></Frame>
    </div>

    </Step>
</Steps>

The contract ABI and Bytecode are available on the Solidity compiler tab.
