Consensus is the task of getting a group of computers (a.k.a. nodes) to come to an agreement on a decision.
In blockchain, this means that all the participants in a network have to agree on the changes made to
the shared ledger. This agreement is reached through a specific process, a consensus protocol,
that ensures that everyone sees the same information and that the information is accurate and trustworthy.

**Avalanche Consensus** is a consensus protocol that is scalable, robust, and decentralized. It
combines features of both classical and Nakamoto consensus mechanisms to achieve high throughput,
fast finality, and
energy efficiency. For the whitepaper, see [here](https://www.avalabs.org/whitepapers).

## Conceptual Overview

Consensus protocols in the Avalanche family operate through repeated sub-sampled voting. When a
node is determining whether a
[transaction](http://support.avalabs.org/en/articles/4587384-what-is-a-transaction) should be
accepted, it asks a small, random subset of
[validator nodes](http://support.avalabs.org/en/articles/4064704-what-is-a-blockchain-validator)
for their preference. Each queried validator replies with the transaction that it prefers, or thinks
should be accepted.

<Note>
Consensus will never include a transaction that is determined to be **invalid**. For example, if you
were to submit a transaction to send 100 AVAX to a friend, but your wallet only has 2 AVAX, this transaction
is considered **invalid** and will not participate in consensus.
</Note>

If a sufficient majority of the validators sampled reply with the same preferred
transaction, this becomes the preferred choice of the validator that inquired.

In the future, this node will reply with the transaction preferred by the majority.

The node repeats this sampling process until the validators
queried reply with the same answer for a sufficient number of consecutive rounds.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Consensus Parameters">
    - The number of validators required to be considered a "sufficient majority" is referred to as "α" (_alpha_).
    - The number of consecutive rounds required to reach consensus, a.k.a. the "Confidence Threshold,"
    is referred to as "β" (_beta_).
    - Both α and β are configurable.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

When a transaction has no conflicts, finalization happens very quickly. When
conflicts exist, honest validators quickly cluster around conflicting transactions, entering a
positive feedback loop until all correct validators prefer that transaction. This leads to the
acceptance of non-conflicting transactions and the rejection of conflicting transactions.

Avalanche Consensus guarantees that if any honest validator accepts a transaction,
all honest validators will come to the same conclusion.

### Intuition

First, let's develop some intuition about the protocol. Imagine a room full of people trying to
agree on what to get for lunch. Suppose it's a binary choice between pizza and barbecue. Some people
might initially prefer pizza while others initially prefer barbecue. Ultimately, though, everyone's
goal is to achieve **consensus**.

Everyone asks a random subset of the people in the room what their lunch preference is. If more than
half say pizza, the person thinks, "OK, looks like things are leaning toward pizza. I prefer pizza
now." That is, they adopt the _preference_ of the majority. Similarly, if a majority say barbecue,
the person adopts barbecue as their preference.

Everyone repeats this process. Each round, more and more people have the same preference. This is
because the more people that prefer an option, the more likely someone is to receive a majority
reply and adopt that option as their preference. After enough rounds, they reach consensus and
decide on one option, which everyone prefers.
