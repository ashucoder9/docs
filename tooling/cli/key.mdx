title: Key
---

The `key` command suite provides a collection of tools for creating and managing
signing keys. You can use these keys to deploy Subnets to the Fuji Testnet,
but these keys are NOT suitable to use in production environments. DO NOT use
these keys on Mainnet.

To get started, use the `key create` command.

## Create

The `key create` command generates a new private key to use for creating and controlling
test Subnets. Keys generated by this command are NOT cryptographically secure enough to
use in production environments. DO NOT use these keys on Mainnet.

The command works by generating a secp256 key and storing it with the provided `keyName`. You
can use this key in other commands by providing this `keyName`.

If you'd like to import an existing key instead of generating one from scratch, provide the
`--file` flag.

<CodeGroup>
```shell Usage
avalanche key create [keyName] [flags]
```

```shell Flags
    --file string   import the key from an existing key file
-f, --force         overwrite an existing key with the same name
-h, --help          help for create
```
</CodeGroup>

## Delete

The `key delete` command deletes an existing signing key.

To delete a key, provide the `keyName`. The command prompts for confirmation
before deleting the key. To skip the confirmation, provide the `--force` flag.

<CodeGroup>
```shell Usage
avalanche key delete [keyName] [flags]
```

```shell Flags
-f, --force   delete the key without confirmation
-h, --help    help for delete
```
</CodeGroup>

## Export

The `key export` command exports a created signing key. You can use an exported key in other
applications or import it into another instance of Avalanche-CLI.

By default, the tool writes the hex encoded key to stdout. If you provide the `--output`
flag, the command writes the key to a file of your choosing.

<CodeGroup>
```shell Usage
avalanche key export [keyName] [flags]
```

```shell Flags
-h, --help            help for export
-o, --output string   write the key to the provided file path
```
</CodeGroup>

## List

The `key list` command prints information for all stored signing
keys or for the ledger addresses associated to certain indices.

<CodeGroup>
```shell Usage
avalanche key list [flags]
```

```shell Flags
-a, --all-networks   list all network addresses
-c, --cchain         list C-Chain addresses (default true)
-f, --fuji           list testnet (fuji) network addresses
-h, --help           help for list
-g, --ledger uints   list ledger addresses for the given indices (default [])
-l, --local          list local network addresses
-m, --mainnet        list mainnet network addresses
-t, --testnet        list testnet (fuji) network addresses
```
</CodeGroup>

## Transfer

The `key transfer` command allows to transfer funds between stored keys or ledger addresses.

<CodeGroup>
```shell Usage
avalanche key transfer [options] [flags]
```

```shell Flags
-o, --amount float                 amount to send or receive (AVAX units)
-f, --force                        avoid transfer confirmation
-u, --fuji                         transfer between testnet (fuji) addresses
-h, --help                         help for transfer
-k, --key string                   key associated to the sender or receiver address
-i, --ledger uint32                ledger index associated to the sender or receiver address (default 32768)
-l, --local                        transfer between local network addresses
-m, --mainnet                      transfer between mainnet addresses
-g, --receive                      receive the transfer
-r, --receive-recovery-step uint   receive step to use for multiple step transaction recovery
-s, --send                         send the transfer
-a, --target-addr string           receiver address
-t, --testnet                      transfer between testnet (fuji) addresses
```
