title: Network
---

The `network` command suite provides a collection of tools for managing local Subnet
deployments.

When you deploy a Subnet locally, it runs on a local, multi-node Avalanche network. The
`subnet deploy` command starts this network in the background. This command suite allows you
to shutdown, restart, and clear that network.

This network currently supports multiple, concurrently deployed Subnets.

## Clean

The `network clean` command shuts down your local, multi-node network. All deployed Subnets
shutdown and delete their state. You can restart the network by deploying a new Subnet
configuration.

<CodeGroup>
```shell Usage
avalanche network clean [flags]
```

```shell Flags
    --hard   Also clean downloaded avalanchego and plugin binaries
-h, --help   help for clean
```
</CodeGroup>

## Start

The `network start` command starts a local, multi-node Avalanche network on your machine.

By default, the command loads the default snapshot. If you provide the `--snapshot-name`
flag, the network loads that snapshot instead. The command fails if the local network is
already running.

<CodeGroup>
```shell Usage
avalanche network start [flags]
```

```shell Flags
    --avalanchego-version string   use this version of avalanchego (ex: v1.17.12) (default "latest")
-h, --help                         help for start
    --snapshot-name string         name of snapshot to use to start the network from (default "default-1654102509")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Status

The `network status` command prints whether or not a local Avalanche network is running and
some basic stats about the network.

<CodeGroup>
```shell Usage
avalanche network status [flags]
```

```shell Flags
-h, --help   help for status
```
</CodeGroup>

## Stop

The `network stop` command shuts down your local, multi-node network.

All deployed Subnets shutdown gracefully and save their state. If you provide the
`--snapshot-name` flag, the network saves its state under this named snapshot. You can
reload this snapshot with `network start --snapshot-name <snapshotName>`. Otherwise, the
network saves to the default snapshot, overwriting any existing state. You can reload the
default snapshot with `network start`.

<CodeGroup>
```shell Usage
avalanche network stop [flags]
```

```shell Flags
-h, --help                   help for stop
    --snapshot-name string   name of snapshot to use to save network state into (default "default-1654102509")
```
