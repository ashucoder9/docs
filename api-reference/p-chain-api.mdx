title: P-Chain API
description: This page is an overview of the P-Chain API associated with AvalancheGo.

This API allows clients to interact with the
[P-Chain](/learn/avalanche/avalanche-platform.md#p-chain), which
maintains Avalanche’s [validator](/nodes/validate/how-to-stake#validators) set and handles
blockchain creation.

## Methods

### `platform.addDelegator`

<Warning>

Deprecated as of [**v1.9.12**](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases/tag/v1.9.12).

</Warning>

<Warning>Not recommended for use on Mainnet. See warning notice in [Keystore API](/reference/avalanchego/keystore-api.md).</Warning>

Add a delegator to the Primary Network.

A delegator stakes AVAX and specifies a validator (the delegatee) to validate on their behalf. The
delegatee has an increased probability of being sampled by other validators (weight) in proportion
to the stake delegated to them.

The delegatee charges a fee to the delegator; the former receives a percentage of the delegator’s
validation reward (if any.) A transaction that delegates stake has no fee.

The delegation period must be a subset of the period that the delegatee validates the Primary
Network.

<Info>Once you issue the transaction to add a node as a delegator, there is no way to change the
parameters. **You can’t remove a stake early or change the stake amount, node ID, or reward
address.** Please make sure you’re using the correct values. If you’re not sure, please reach out to
us on [Discord.](https://chat.avalabs.org/)</Info>

**Signature:**

```sh
platform.addDelegator(
    {
        nodeID: string,
        startTime: int,
        endTime: int,
        stakeAmount: int,
        rewardAddress: string,
        from: []string, // optional
        changeAddr: string, // optional
        username: string,
        password: string
    }
) ->
{
    txID: string,
    changeAddr: string
}
```

- `nodeID` is the ID of the node to delegate to.
- `startTime` is the Unix time when the delegator starts delegating.
- `endTime` is the Unix time when the delegator stops delegating (and staked AVAX is returned).
- `stakeAmount` is the amount of nAVAX the delegator is staking.
- `rewardAddress` is the address the validator reward goes to, if there is one.
- `from` are the addresses that you want to use for this operation. If omitted, uses any of your
  addresses as needed.
- `changeAddr` is the address any change will be sent to. If omitted, change is sent to one of the
  addresses controlled by the user.
- `username` is the user that pays the transaction fee.
- `password` is `username`‘s password.
- `txID` is the transaction ID
